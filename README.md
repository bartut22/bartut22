## Hi there 👋 I'm Bartu (bar-two) Tunctan

I'll be starting school at Rice University next fall to pursue Computer Science. I'm passionate about coding, and I'm most proficient in JavaScript (React/React Native to be specific). During my studies, I plan to create solutions for reducing car dependency in America while connecting coding to my other interests: exercise science, music, and math.

**Currently working on**
SightReed: a Next.js web app with free, unlimited sight-reading practice for musicians.

**Technologies I use**

- JavaScript / TypeScript

- React & React Native

- Next.js

- Web app architecture & UI design

**Contact**
